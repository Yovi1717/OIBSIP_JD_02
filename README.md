Excited to Share My Latest Project at Oasis Infobyte! 


I've recently developed an engaging Java program for a Number Guessing Game. This game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number, providing hints if their guess is too high or too low until they get it right. Using Java and its core libraries, I created a fun and interactive tool that offers clear instructions and feedback.
ðŸ“Š Key Features:


Random number generation

Real-time feedback on user guesses

Display of the total number of attempts upon correct guess

Easy-to-use console interface

ðŸ”§ Technical Skills Demonstrated:


Java Programming

Effective handling of user input

Implementation of loops and conditionals for game logic

Design of a user-friendly console interface

A huge thank you to Oasis Infobyte for the support!
